        <h2>Swim Instructing</h2>
        <p>I have been teaching kids how to swim for 3 years now. Since ive been swimming my whole life, telling them about the strokes and correcting them wasn't terrible difficult. The biggest thing i learned from it was how to handle various children and their needs. I've even worked with kids that have special needs.</p>
